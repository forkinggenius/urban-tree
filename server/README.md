# urban-tree / server
NodeJS tree file explorer server for urban-tree

## Get Started

### Clone Repository

Fortunately, the client is packaged in the same repository as the `ubran-tree` project.
So, you won't need to make any additional cloning.
But you'll need to change the directory to the frontend client.

```sh
cd server
```

### Install Dependencies

We're already using the node version manager rc file from the parent directory, so we'll just
install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the Server

We've added a script that will help you run the server instantly.

But when running the server, you'll want to add the path to the directories you want to observe,
so make sure you include them as parameters as shown below.

```sh
npm run deploy <path-1> <path-2> <path-3> ...
```

In case you'd like to learn more about the scripts available, you can find them [here](#glossary)
