## Get Started

### Clone Repository

Cloning is a pretty standard task, but if you need a hand, you can find the command below (uses HTTPS).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nizarmah/urban-tree.git
```

Make sure to cd into the cloned project after.

### Specify Node Version

Initially, make sure you have [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed.

```sh
nvm --version
```

Once you ensure that you have `nvm`, you'll want to install the version we're using here.

```sh
nvm install
```

Now that we've installed the version being used by this repository, let's officially use it.

```sh
nvm use
```
