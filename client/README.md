# urban-tree / client
React tree file explorer client for ubran-tree

## Get Started

### Clone Repository

Fortunately, the client is packaged in the same repository as the `ubran-tree` project.
So, you won't need to make any additional cloning.
But you'll need to change the directory to the frontend client.

```sh
cd client
```

### Install Dependencies

We're already using the node version manager rc file from the parent directory, so we'll just
install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the Server

```sh
npm run dev
```
